PIL is not available in jython. This is not neccessarily such 
a bad thing since one does not really want to do this type of work on 
the server on each request when the browser can cache the image after 
a single retrieval.
However it does mean that Pinax also does not work on Jython.
But the problem comes in with Django 1.4 and 1.5 support that is still 
a bit shaky:
the backend suppor is still dodgy - 
I had to change code in SQLLite base.py (included self in calls to DatabaseOperations(), etc)
postgresql just would not even load.

The War building is still a bit weird. It could not pick up all the right images and stylesheets
It seems to include a heck of a lot of py files but the end result is not too big (50MB)

During development, the build cycle is a quite a challenge, +- a minute or so. I need to optimize that still

And then still just these freakin arbitrary Attribute not found and things
Permgenspace. It reloads the entire jython infrastructure every time. This is massive. There is a way to share the core jar though though
